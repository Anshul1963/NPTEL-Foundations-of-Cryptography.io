2. Select the incorrect option(s) for Trivium cipher:
    It is a software oriented stream cipher
    The cipher uses a key as well as an initial vector
    It is an asynchronous cipher
    Uses multiple feedback shift registers in non-linear fashion
Accepted Answers:
It is a software oriented stream cipher
It is an asynchronous cipher

3. Which of the following candidates is(are) necessarily secure PRF(s)? In all the following options, Fs(x) is a secure PRF, where x,s∈{0,1}n and output is also an n-bit string.
    Gs(x)=Fs(x)⊕Fs(x¯)
    Gs(x)=FFs(x)(x)
    Gs(x)=F1n(x)||Fs(x)
    Gs(x)=1||Fs(x), where || denotes the concatenation operation
Accepted Answers:
Gs(x)=FFs(x)(x)

4. Let Π=(Gen,Enc,Dec) be a symmetric-key cipher. Then consider a variant Π′=(Gen,Enc′,Dec′) of Π, where Enc′k(m)=Enck(reverse(m)). The steps of Dec′ are performed accordingly. Here reverse(m)denotes the bit string obtained by reversing the order of the bits of m
    If Π is single-message COA-secure, then Π′ is also single-message COA-secure
    If Π is single-message COA-secure, then Π′ may not be single-message COA-secure
    If Π is CPA-secure, then Π′ is also CPA-secure
    None of the above
Accepted Answers:
If Π is single-message COA-secure, then Π′ is also single-message COA-secure
If Π is CPA-secure, then Π′ is also CPA-secure

5. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
    A single-message CPA-secure encryption scheme is also a multi-message CPA-secure scheme
    Secure PRGs can be constructed using secure PRFs and vice-versa
    Given F is a secure PRF and let s∈{0,1}n and x∈{0,1}n−1, then the construction F′s(x):=Fs(0||x)||Fs(x||1) is a secure PRF
    A strong PRP is indistinguishable by an efficient adversary from a true random permutation, even in presence of an inverse oracle
