1. Choose the option(s) that are incorrect for DES:
    The round function in DES is a substitution-permutation network
    Block length of 64 bits and a key length of 56 bits are the shortcomings of DES
    Each S-box defines an 8 to 1 function
    A 1-bit change to a DES S-box input ensures at most 1-bit change in the output
    DES is secure against exhaustive search attack.

2. Choose the option(s) that are correct for AES:
    AES block cipher has a 128-bit block length and uses a 128-bit key
    AES is not a substitution-permutation network
    The S-box function in the SubBytes operation is a bijective function
    AES block cipher is not proven to be secure against computational adversary

Accepted Answers:
  The S-box function in the SubBytes operation is a bijective function
  AES block cipher is not proven to be secure against computational adversary
  
  
3. Consider the following encryption schemes.  Which of the following option(s) is/are not true for the given encryption schemes?
	I)  Given F is a secure PRP.  Choose a key k∈{0,1}n at random. To encrypt m∈{0,1}n/2, the cipher text is c=Fk(m||r) where r∈{0,1}n/2 is a random bit string (|| denotes concatenation of strings).  The decryption function outputs m, where m||r:=F−1k(c).
	II)  Given F is a secure PRF.  Choose a key k∈{0,1}n at random. To encrypt m∈{0,1}n, the cipher text is (r,c=m⊕FFk(r)(r)) where r∈{0,1}n is a random bit string.      The decryption is m:=c⊕FFk(r)(r).
  
  I and II are CCA secure encryption schemes
  I is CPA secure and II is CCA secure
  I is CCA secure and II is CPA secure
  Both I and II are not CPA secure encryption schemes
  None of the above

Accepted Answers:
  I and II are CCA secure encryption schemes
  I is CPA secure and II is CCA secure
  Both I and II are not CPA secure encryption schemes
  
  
4. Select the correct option(s) with respect to Message Authentication Code (MAC):
    The tag verification algorithm must be randomized.
    MAC for fixed-length messages constructed using PRF is SCMA secure.
    Head of Organization sending a broadcast e-mail to employees is an example application that requires encryption and not authentication.
    Streaming MAC is the one which does not require the length of the message known in advance.

Accepted Answers:
MAC for fixed-length messages constructed using PRF is SCMA secure.
Streaming MAC is the one which does not require the length of the message known in advance.


5. Which of the following is/are not true about Message Authentication Codes?
    CBC MAC can be used to generate tag for only fixed length messages.
    Block-wise CBC MAC initialized with IV=1n, instead of IV being the number of message blocks will be secure
    A secure MAC does not maintain the privacy of the underlying message
    All of the above

Accepted Answers:
  CBC MAC can be used to generate tag for only fixed length messages.
  Block-wise CBC MAC initialized with IV=1n, instead of IV being the number of message blocks will be secure
