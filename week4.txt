1. Which of the following is/are true about modes of operation?
    A sequence of n messages need at least n calls to a secure PRF for encryption
    Cipher-text computation is parallelizable in CTR mode.
    Plain text of any length cannot be encrypted in OFB mode.
    Stateful variant of Counter mode is secure whereas that of OFB mode is insecure.
Accepted Answers:
A sequence of n messages need at least n calls to a secure PRF for encryption
Cipher-text computation is parallelizable in CTR mode.

2. Select the incorrect option(s) from the following:
    Assuming all block cipher constructions use secure PRFs, this implies they all are CPA-secure.
    Assuming secure PRPs are used in their construction, the stateless version of CBC-mode encryption is CPA-secure while the stateful version is not.
    Assuming secure PRFs are used in their construction, the stateless version of OFB-mode encryption is CPA-secure while the stateful version is not.
    None of the above.

3. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
    An r-round Subtitution-Permutation network has r rounds of key-mixing, substitution and permutation.
    S-boxes used in an SPN are always invertible.
    A 3-round Feistel network is secure whereas a 2-round one is not.
    Since the components in a Feistel network are not necessarily invertible, the Feistel network is also non-invertible.
Accepted Answers:
A 3-round Feistel network is secure whereas a 2-round one is not.

4. Given Fk is a secure PRF, define F′k(x)={Fk(x), if x is evenFk(x+1), if x is odd}. Then which of the following is(are) true?
    Fk is a not secure PRF  
    Fk is a secure PRP
    Fk cannot be used to instantiate the OFB mode of block cipher 
    Fk can be used to instantiate the CTR mode of block cipher 
Accepted Answers:
Fk is a not secure PRF  
Fk cannot be used to instantiate the OFB mode of block cipher 

5. Let F:{0,1}n×{0,1}n→{0,1}n be a secure PRF. Then which of the following constructions is/are a secure PRF? 
    F′:{0,1}n×{0,1}2n→{0,1}n where F′k(x||y)=defFk(x)⊕Fk(y)
    F′:{0,1}n×{0,1}2n→{0,1}2n where F′k(x||y)=defFk(x)||Fk(y)
    F′:{0,1}n×{0,1}2n→{0,1}n where F′k(x||y)=defFk(x)∧Fk(y)
    F′:{0,1}n×{0,1}n→{0,1}2n where F′k(x)=defFk(x)||Fk(x⊕1n)
    None of the above
