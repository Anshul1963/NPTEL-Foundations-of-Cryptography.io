1. Select the incorrect option(s) for the Merkle-Damgård transformation:
    It employs a single-stage approach for the transformation.
    This construction will always add a padding to the message which depends upon the length of the message.
    The initial vector (IV) used in this construction has to be fixed.
    Collision resistance of the transformation is independent of the collision resistance of the compression function used in its construction.

Accepted Answers:
  It employs a single-stage approach for the transformation.
  Collision resistance of the transformation is independent of the collision resistance of the compression function used in its construction.


2. Choose the incorrect option(s) from the following: 
    Hash functions can either be used for compression or for expansion, but not both.
    The probability of finding a collision for a given hash function depends on the domain of the function.
    We can construct a hash function with zero probability of collision.
    Hash algorithms can be used in MAC as well as in the generation of PRGs.

Accepted Answers:
  Hash functions can either be used for compression or for expansion, but not both.
  We can construct a hash function with zero probability of collision.


3. Given Hand G are collision resistant hash functions. Which of these functions is/are collision-resistant?
    F1(x):=H(x)||G(x)
    F2(x):=H(x)||1
    F3(x):=H(x)⊕G(x)
    None of the above functions.

Accepted Answers:
  F1(x):=H(x)||G(x)
  F2(x):=H(x)||1


4. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
    Information theoretic MACs are secure only against an adversary running for polynomial time.
    Perfect unforgeability is not analogous to perfect secrecy.
    One-time IT-secure MAC is not analogous to one-time pad used in encryption.
    In the Ideal-cipher model, only the adversary does not have access to the working of the SPRP used in a given construction.

Accepted Answers:
  Perfect unforgeability is not analogous to perfect secrecy.
  One-time IT-secure MAC is not analogous to one-time pad used in encryption.


5. Let F:{0,1}n×{0,1}n→{0,1}n be a keyed function and let H:M→{0,1}n  be a function, where M={0,1}≤ℓ, where ℓ is some polynomial function of the security parameter. 
   Then consider the keyed function F′:{0,1}n×M→{0,1}n, where F′k(m)=Fk(H(m)). Which of the following is/are true?
      F′ can never be a secure PRF.
      If F is a secure PRF, then F′ is a secure PRF.
      If H is collision-resistant, then F′ is a secure PRF.
      If F is a secure PRF and H is collision-resistant, then F′ is a secure PRF.

Accepted Answers:
If F  is a secure PRF and H is collision-resistant, then F′ is a secure PRF.
